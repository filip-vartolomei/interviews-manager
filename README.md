## React Interviews Manager


This project is a playground when I was learning **React**.

This project is a managment in one place of your current interviews, so that you don't get lost with e-mails, and keep your mind clear.

This app is still in development, and when it will be quite ready, will publish a link to the demo.

If you want to try this app on your local machine,
clone this repo and run:
```js
  yarn
  or npm install
```
